## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸš€ This space contains files, scripts, and resources for my PhD research in high-energy physics, focusing on beyond Standard Model processes using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning.

## Repository Contents ðŸ§ªðŸ“‚

This repository includes:
- **Event Simulation:** Generating and analyzing signal and background events (MadGraph, Pythia, Delphes).
- **Kinematical Reconstruction:** Identifying jet substructure and relevant signatures.
- **Machine Learning:** Implementing neural networks and other classification models.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Evaluating performance using significance tests and other methods.
- **Data Processing:** Feature extraction, transformation, and handling for analysis.
- **Documentation:** Theory, methodology, and step-by-step usage guides.
