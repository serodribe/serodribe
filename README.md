## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸš€ This space contains files, scripts, and resources for my PhD research in high-energy physics, focusing on a beyond Standard Model process using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning.

## Research Overview ðŸ§ª

I work on:
- **Event Simulation:** Generating and analyzing signal and background events.
- **Jet Reconstruction:** Identifying jet substructure and relevant signatures.
- **Machine Learning:** Using classification models to distinguish events.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Evaluating significance with various methods.

## Repository Contents ðŸ“‚

- **Simulation Scripts:** Monte Carlo event generation (MadGraph, Pythia, Delphes).
- **Data Processing:** Feature extraction and transformation.
- **ML Models:** Neural networks for classification.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Performance evaluation and significance tests.
- **Documentation:** Theory, methodology, and usage guides.
