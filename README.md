## About My Research ðŸ§ª

I am a PhD student working on:

- **Event Simulation:** Generating and analyzing simulated signal and background events.
- **Jet Reconstruction:** Identifying jet substructure and relevant physics signatures.
- **Machine Learning:** Using classification models to distinguish physical processes.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying methods to evaluate the significance of results.

## Repository Contents ðŸ“‚

- **Simulation Scripts:** Monte Carlo event generation (MadGraph, Pythia, Delphes).
- **Data Processing Tools:** Feature extraction and data transformation.
- **ML Models:** Neural networks for classification.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Performance evaluation, including Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
- **Documentation:** Theory, methodology, and usage guides.
